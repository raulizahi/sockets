Hi everyone.

This code is meant for people that want to learn to use some features of C and Unix/Linux.

Use ports between 1025 and 9999.

127.0.0.1 is the same machine that you are running, otherwise please use the IP address of the machine running the server.

Example of usage is:

- 'make'
- in one window: 'server 9999'
- in another window: 'send 127.0.0.1 999 Hello'

Finish the server by sending the word 'done'.

Lots more to be added, but didn't want to wait to share it.

Raul
