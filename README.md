Hi everyone.

This code is meant for people that want to learn to use some features of C and Unix/Linux.

Use ports between 1025 and 9999.

127.0.0.1 is the same machine that you are running, otherwise please use the IP address of the machine running the server.

Usage is:

- 'make'
- in one window: 'server 9999'
- in another window: 'send 127.0.0.1 999 Hello'
